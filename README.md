# 1. Introduction to PCB Design

In this section, we introduce you to the basic concepts and terminology of PCB design, which are essential for anyone starting in this field. You will also learn about the role of CAD tools in PCB design and how to get started with your first project.

---

## 1.1 Introduction and Important Terminology

### What is Printed Circuit Board Design?

A **PCB (Printed Circuit Board)** is a flat board used to physically support and electrically connect electronic components. The components such as resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits (ICs) are attached to the board using copper traces to form the electrical connections.

### Basic Terminology to Help You Get Started

- **Component:** A physical part like a resistor, capacitor, or IC that gets mounted on the PCB.
- **Trace:** Copper paths that connect components on the PCB.
- **Via:** A small hole in the PCB used to connect traces between different layers of the board.
- **Pad:** The area on the PCB where component leads are soldered.

Understanding these terms is crucial when working with PCB design tools and while creating your own PCBs.

## 1.2 The Role of CAD Tools

### What are CAD Tools?

**CAD (Computer-Aided Design)** tools are software used to design electrical circuits and PCBs. These tools allow designers to create **schematics** and **PCB layouts**. Popular CAD tools include **KiCad**, **Eagle**, and **Altium Designer**.

### Key CAD Tool Features

- **Schematic Sheets**: Represent the electrical connections between components.
- **PCB Layout**: Shows how components are placed on the physical PCB and how the traces connect them.
- **Bill of Materials (BOM)**: A list of all the components used in the PCB design, with part numbers and quantities.

## 1.3 Your First PCB Project

In this section, you will start your journey by creating your first PCB project. This includes:

- Setting up a new project.
- Creating your first schematic.
- Moving to the PCB layout and organizing your components.
- Exporting your design for manufacturing.

Watch the video tutorials provided to guide you through each step.

## 1.4 Summary

This section covered the basics of **PCB Design**, including:

- The concept of PCBs and the components that make up a PCB.
- The essential terminology used in PCB design (components, traces, vias, etc.).
- The role of CAD tools in creating schematics and layouts.
- Getting started with your first PCB project.

You now have the foundation to move forward with more advanced PCB design topics. Continue to the next sections to learn about specific aspects of PCB design such as schematic design, PCB layout, and creating the Bill of Materials (BOM).

---

By the end of this guide, you will have gained a solid understanding of PCB design, which will allow you to create your own functional circuit boards!
